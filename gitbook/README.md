React Native Fiber is a starter kit for React Native and NativeBase.
Fiber is based on the UI Kit of the same name from Framer and is focused on animations.
You can use them as turn key solutions for your next project.
This project has been rewritten using es6 with flow annotations for type checking.
The visual design can easily be customized and all aspects of the app are implemented: from navigation using react-navigation to data management.

With the [expo client](https://expo.io/tools#mobile), you can try the starter kit by using this [link](https://expo.io/@wcandillon/react-native-fiber).
